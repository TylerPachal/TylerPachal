### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Scientist with an interest in functional programming, reactive systems, and observability.

Lately I am really enjoying working in Elixir and am a co-organizer of the [Toronto Elixir Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/torontoelixir/). 

I am motivated by learning new things, and solving deep technical challenges. When I learn something new, I like to teach other people about it; in the past I have given talks, run workshops, and written blogposts.
